# About

This repository considers the following selection problem: Given m >= 2 disjoint sets
T_1, ..., T_m, find a tuple (t_1, ...., t_m) in T_1 x ... x T_m which maximises/minimises an 
objective of the form sum_{1<=i<j<=m} c_ij t_i t_j where c_ij are given.

The code in this repo offers to export the h-representation for different linearisations. 

# Execution

Run `python3 main.py -h` in order to see all command line arguments.
